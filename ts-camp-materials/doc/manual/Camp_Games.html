Leaders. A "count off" from a circle (assign each student a number, put all 1&rsquo;s with this
TL, 2&rsquo;s with that TL, etc) or instructing them to find their OWN team consisting of one
member from each camp group &ndash; either works!</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">Head Coach explains all these rules to everyone, before sending them on their hunt:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul class="compact"><li><p>Stick with your team! You cannot leave any members of your team behind.</p></li><li><p>Explain the boundaries of the Search Area.</p></li><li><p>Each team must take a group selfie with everything on the list.*</p></li><li><p>Give a return time!</p></li></ul></div></p><p>* If there is a no-photos student, make them the photographer, in charge of snapping the
shot of everyone else on their team and the object.</p><p>HC should reinforce a few key points with TLs &ndash; the boundaries and return time
especially. HC can text or give a physical list of all the items to find to each TL.</p><p>As teams return, HC checks the photos; looking for every team member in each photos and
that they got everything on the list. Celebrate every team as they return!</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">EXAMPLE LISTS:</span>
Aim for 5-10 items on the list, depedning on how much time you are allowing for the hunt.
Leave some open ended items, where the thing to found might be different for everyone
(like "A Beautiful View") and include some riddles for extra fun!</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">Here were 2 seperate lists created for an old camp location at UCSD. Notes (not given to

few days. If needed, they can step out for 10 minutes during a kata
section to finalize their list before playing. Share any finished lists
with HQ so they can be passed on to future HCs!</p></li></ul><h4 x-source-module="(lib &quot;ts-camp-materials/scribblings/manual.scrbl&quot;)" x-source-pkg="ts-camp-materials" x-part-tag="&quot;Duck_Duck_Goose&quot;">6.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Duck_.Duck_.Goose)"></a>Duck Duck Goose</h4><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Recommended for: K-2nd</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">NEED:</span></p><ul><li><p>Enough space for a circle of all players, and space to run around the

(ideally also out of hearing range) of the circle.</p></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: bold">HOW TO PLAY:</span></p><p>One student is the "detective" and leaves the area (keep in mind, they need to be
accompanied but shouldn&rsquo;t be alone with an adult). The teacher picks one of the remaining
students to be the Leader. The Leader starts a simple movement (tapping head, clapping
hands, drumming fingers, etc) and the rest of the circle copies it. The Detective student
returns, and stands in the middle of the circle. Their job is to try and figure out who is
the Leader. Meanwhile, everyone is trying to follow the Leader as they change up the
movement, without giving away who the Leader is to the Detective. The round ends when the
Detective guesses correctly, or has three incorrect guesses.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">TIPS &amp; TRICKS:</span></p><ul><li><p>May have to remind students not to directly stare at the Leader, but rather
use their peripheral vision, or pay attention to someone else and match
them!</p></li></ul><h4 x-source-module="(lib &quot;ts-camp-materials/scribblings/manual.scrbl&quot;)" x-source-pkg="ts-camp-materials" x-part-tag="&quot;Shark_Attack&quot;">6.4<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Shark_.Attack)"></a>Shark Attack</h4><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Recommended for: K-2nd, 3-5, 6-10</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">NEED:</span></p><ul class="compact"><li><p>Scrap paper that is okay to be ripped/stepped on. Newspaper or large paper
is ideal, but scratch printer paper works in a pinch.</p></li><li><p>Enough space for everyone to walk around comfortably.</p></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: bold">HOW TO PLAY:</span></p><p>Staff spread out papers on the ground throughout the space, starting with as many papers as
there are students. Head Coach instructs students to "swim" around the space, while
explaining that they are on a tropical vacation, swimming amongst these plentiful islands
(the papers). Then all of a sudden there is a "SHARK ATTACK" and all students must safely
get on an island.</p><p>Once everyone has gotten to safety, tell the students that the shark has gone away and it
is safe to swim again. As they are swimming, remove one piece of paper from the playing
space. Another "SHARK ATTACK" comes, and everyone must still get to safety &ndash; someone is
going to have to share their island. Explain that the point is to save as many of your
fellow vacationers as possible. Once one person is stranded; everyone loses!</p><p>The game continues, with pieces of paper getting ripped smaller or removed every round.
Once one person has been lost to the shark (hasn&rsquo;t been able to fit on the paper), the game
is over.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">TIPS &amp; TRICKS:</span></p><ul class="compact"><li><p>This game is about teamwork, not competition. Kids aren&rsquo;t as used to that,
and they may need some reminding that they want to save everyone!</p></li><li><p>As usual, the more that the staff gets into the game, the more the students
will play along!</p></li></ul><h4 x-source-module="(lib &quot;ts-camp-materials/scribblings/manual.scrbl&quot;)" x-source-pkg="ts-camp-materials" x-part-tag="&quot;Ultimate_Rock_Paper_Scissors&quot;">6.5<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Ultimate_.Rock_.Paper_.Scissors)"></a>Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors</h4><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Recommended for: K-2nd, 3-5</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">NEED:</span></p><ul><li><p>Enough space to walk around.</p></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: bold">HOW TO PLAY:</span></p><p>First, review the game of rock paper scissors, especially when you reveal your pick (on
"scissors" or "shoot?"). Students wander the room and find an opponent. They play RPS. The
student who loses becomes the winner&rsquo;s cheerleader; chanting their name and otherwise
cheering them on as they go on to find their next opponent. So it goes, with the student
who loses and all their cheerleaders joining the winner&rsquo;s cheer team until you have an
ultimate winner! Play this game a couple times.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">TIPS &amp; TRICKS:</span></p><ul class="compact"><li><p>As with any competitive game, make it as lighthearted and low-stakes as
possible. You lost this time, so what? You get to be a cheerleader! Better
luck next time!</p></li><li><p>Keep in mind any neighbors and noise constraints you need to make &ndash;
whispering cheerleaders?</p></li></ul><h4 x-source-module="(lib &quot;ts-camp-materials/scribblings/manual.scrbl&quot;)" x-source-pkg="ts-camp-materials" x-part-tag="&quot;Captain_s_Coming&quot;">6.6<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Captain_s_.Coming)"></a>Captain&rsquo;s Coming</h4><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Recommended for: K-2nd, 3-5, 6-10</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">NEED:</span></p><ul class="compact"><li><p>Largish space for students to be able move around safely</p></li><li><p>List of commands and responses</p></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: bold">HOW TO PLAY:</span></p><p>Head Coach is the captain of the ship and students are their crew. A good crew follows their
Captain&rsquo;s instructions to a tee! Start with the four directions (see list below) adding on new
commands as the students become comfortable &ndash; introducing the command, demonstrating the
response, and practicing it a few times.</p><p>This may be played as an elimination game or not. If you play "with outs" have the students who
are out of the game join the Captain&rsquo;s team and help judge. Remind them that the Captain (and
other team leaders) are the final judges, and they are assisting. Captain can ask suggestions for
what command to say next, or they can continue to play the game behind the Captain to keep them
engaged. Students can get out by doing the wrong instruction, breaking "Captain&rsquo;s Coming" for
anything but "At Ease" and, if they get advance enough for numbered commands, being the odd one(s)
out.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara"><span style="font-weight: bold">STARTING COMMANDS:</span>

sick do it quick! I wanna hear a quick upchuck like *demonstrates* then

during which time, all statues are getting into a starting pose. The goal of the guard is to catch
someone moving, while the goal of the statues is to only move when the guard&rsquo;s back is turned. If

pulling funny faces, etc. Still no touching though!</p></li><li><p>To add an extra thrill, play in semi-darkness where the guard has a flashlight/</p></li><li><p>When out, statues become guard dogs and can help alert the guard to movement by
barking. This can quickly get out of hand &ndash; so prepare for a lot of noise. To try and
contain the crazy, you can make a "dog cage" where all the dogs have to stay, out of

realize, but this is not a
racing game. They are most successful when they move as a group and stick together! If there is

is the Narrator, and they secretly assign students roles by silently tapping heads. They assign
2-3 people to be Mafia, and 1-2 people to be the Doctor(s). It is imperative that all these
assignments are top secret!</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Nighttime:</span> The Narrator instructs the Mafia to open their eyes and SILENTLY point at one of
the sleeping townspeople to kill. The Narrator confirms (silently) then tells all Mafia to go back
to sleep. Then the Narrator asks the Doctor(s) to awake, who will then choose whom amongst the
sleeping townspeople they wish to save, also by pointing. Narrator confirms and sends them back
to sleep.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Morning:</span> Narrator asks everyone to wake up. This is where it gets fun! A big part of this
game is the weaving of crazy, funny, ridiculous stories &ndash; this little town with a hidden mafia,
tragic deaths, and if you are lucky, amazing life-saving heroics. The Narrator reveals
(hopefully dramatically) who was killed in the night, and, if the Doctors&rsquo; pick matches the
Mafia&rsquo;s, tells the amazing story of their recovery. When someone is "killed" or "jailed" they
leave the circle and become a SILENT ghost.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">The Vote:</span> The Narrator goes around and leads a public vote of who is Mafia. Narrator
indicats each townsperson one by one, and counting the raised hands. Each townsperson holds up as
many fingers as they got votes (to keep track). Townspeople can attempt to convince each other of
who is guilty! Whoever has the most votes is thrown in prison, and joins the ghosts. Then the
whole town goes back to sleep.</p><p>Game continues in the loop of nighttime, morning, vote, nighttime, morning, vote etc. until all
the Mafia are jailed or there are no innocents left!</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">TIPS &amp; TRICKS:</span></p><ul class="compact"><li><p>Warning, this is one of those games that once played, students might always beg to

were actually Mafia or not. Or it can stay a secret until the end!</p></li><li><p>The violence theme can be a bit too much for younger grades. If you have any
reason to be concerned, you can not use the word "kill," instead going with a fitting
euphemism ("sleeping with the fishes" anyone?) or trying something else all together

someone else in the circle without losing their spot to the middle person! The people on the
outside must use silent ways of communicating to negotiate a switch, so they don&rsquo;t give away their
plan to the middle person. There are two ways of playing this game from here:</p><ul><li><p>BEGINNER VERSION: The person in the middle has to spend their time going up to
people on the outside asking them "May I have your spot?" to which the outside person
replies "No, go ask (name of someone else in the circle)." This distracts the middle
person and gives them something to do while waiting! Also doubles as a name-learning
game.</p></li><li><p>ADVANCED GROUPS: The person in the middle  tries to keep an eye on everyone and

everyone immediately jumps back into their starting position (wherever and however they land,
they are frozen). Whomever is chosen to go first gets one movement to attempt to hit anyone else&rsquo;s
hand with their own. A movement can be just your arm or whole body jump, as long as it is a
single movement done all at the same time. Whomever they are attacking has a single move to
defend themselves at that moment (moving their hand/whole body out of the way). If their hand is
hit, they put it behind their back, having "lost" that hand. As soon as that exchange of
simultaneous moment has ended, the person to the starter player&rsquo;s right can attack. So it goes
around the circle, sudden attacks and defenses. When someone loses both hands, they are out of
