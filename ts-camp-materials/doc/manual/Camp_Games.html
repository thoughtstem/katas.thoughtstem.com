that they got everything on the list. Celebrate every team as they return!</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">EXAMPLE LISTS:</span>
Aim for 5-10 items on the list, depending on how much time you are allowing for the hunt.

accompanied but shouldn&rsquo;t be alone with an adult). The teacher picks one of the remaining
players to be the Leader. The Leader starts a simple movement (tapping head, clapping
hands, drumming fingers, etc) and the rest of the circle copies it. The Detective player
returns, and stands in the middle of the circle. Their job is to try and figure out who is
the Leader. Meanwhile, everyone is trying to follow the Leader as they change up the
movement, without giving away who the Leader is to the Detective. The round ends when the
Detective guesses correctly, or has three incorrect guesses.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">TIPS &amp; TRICKS:</span></p><ul><li><p>May have to remind players not to directly stare at the Leader, but rather

there are players. Head Coach instructs players to "swim" around the space, while
explaining that they are on a tropical vacation, swimming amongst these plentiful islands
(the papers). Then all of a sudden there is a "SHARK ATTACK" and all players must safely
get on an island.</p><p>Once everyone has gotten to safety, tell the players that the shark has gone away and it
is safe to swim again. As they are swimming, remove one piece of paper from the playing
space. Another "SHARK ATTACK" comes, and everyone must still get to safety &ndash; someone is
going to have to share their island. Explain that the point is to save as many of your
fellow vacationers as possible. Once one person is stranded; everyone loses!</p><p>The game continues, with pieces of paper getting ripped smaller or removed every round.
Once one person has been lost to the shark (hasn&rsquo;t been able to fit on the paper), the game
is over.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">TIPS &amp; TRICKS:</span></p><ul class="compact"><li><p>This game is about teamwork, not competition. Kids aren&rsquo;t as used to that,

their hands, palms down, on the ground in front of them. Everyone lifts their right hand and
places it on the other side of the left hand of the person directly to their right &ndash; ending up
with everyone&rsquo;s arms overlapping and criss-crossed.</p><p>Starting player taps their right hand on the ground. The taps continue clockwise around the
circle in the order of hands on the ground, not players! Any player who taps their hand out of
order, or is too delayed in realizing it is their turn to tap, pulls that hand from the circle.
When both of a player&rsquo;s hands are pulled out, they are out. Play continues until there is one (or
a couple) winners remaining!</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">In addition to tapping hands clockwise, there are a couple ways to change the flow that any

move their paper off their back (stick it on the front of their shirt?) and continue to help
other players by answering their questions.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Variation for younger players</span> &ndash; Instead of characters, use animals. Questions adjust to
"Do I live on land?" "Do I walk on 4 legs?" "Do people have me as a pet?"</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Variation for older players</span> &ndash; Have the players write the names instead of prepping them
beforehand. Give them parameters (at the least: something everyone will know. Can be more

gets the name they wrote.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara"><span style="font-weight: bold">Example Names:</span>
