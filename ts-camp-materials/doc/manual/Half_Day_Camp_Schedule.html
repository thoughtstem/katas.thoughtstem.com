and Friday are all slightly different. The reasons for this are straightforward:</p><ol><li><p>Additional time for check-in is allowed on Monday, since
all students and staff will stay at the pick up location until 9:15
on the first day.</p></li><li><p>Also, the first activities are icebreakers, for obvious reasons!</p></li><li><p>For Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday, these extra 15 minutes go into
game time.</p></li><li><p>On Friday there is GAME JAM! The last hour and a half are spent on
this.</p></li></ol><h5 x-source-module="(lib &quot;ts-camp-materials/scribblings/manual.scrbl&quot;)" x-source-pkg="ts-camp-materials" x-part-tag="&quot;Check-in&quot;">3.2.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Check-in)"></a>Check-in</h5><p><span class="Larger">AM &ndash; mon 8:45am-9:15am &amp; tue-fri 8:45am-9:00am</span></p><p><span class="Larger">PM &ndash; mon 12:45pm-1:15pm &amp; tue-fri 12:45pm-1:00pm</span></p><p>It is important to start check-in on time, <span style="font-weight: bold">but not early!</span> On the first day,
all staff and students stay at the pick up location until all students arrive, or
9:15am &ndash; whichever comes first. All other days, all students and the majority of
staff go to the camp room at 9am, and one Team Leader will stay at the pick up
location until all students have arrived or 9:15 &ndash; whichever comes first.</p><p>In most locations, parents should be staying in their cars during drop off.The
one exception to this rule is on Day One: when parents need to stay with their
student until the Head Coach confirms that ThoughtSTEM has all paperwork required.</p><p>To run a smooth and successful check-in, each coach should take over a specific
job in the check in process:</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold"><span class="Larger">Head Coach</span></span></p><p><div class="SIntrapara">The Head Coach duties during check-in are:

(ex. wandering off, playing with sticks, throwing rocks, etc)</p></li><li><p>Fostering a comfortable, welcoming environment by talking to
                students, starting conversations between students and going
                out of their way to engage students on the fringe. <span style="font-weight: bold">This is especially important on day one!</span></p></li></ul></div></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold"><span class="Larger">Runners &ndash; 1-2 Team Leaders</span></span></p><p><div class="SIntrapara">These TLs move between cars, completing the following duties:

or two TLs to stay in the camp room and finish up. Some locations require this, see
the note below:</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold"><span class="Larger">Monitoring Camp Room</span></span></p><p>We can never leave our equipment alone in an unlocked room; this means that a TL will
have to remain behind every day during check-in at some locations. This TL can complete

are part of a larger camp where the main staff handles check-in. Others require
slightly different jobs:</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Fleet Science Center</span></p><ul class="compact"><li><p>On first day check in, Head Coach needs to confirm the authorized

Kata. Once all students have earned the kata (HC and Team Leaders working
together to award kata card hole punches and dollars), HC hands it over the the
TLs, who start their team on the first kata section. See more details on
teaching katas below:</p><h5 x-source-module="(lib &quot;ts-camp-materials/scribblings/manual.scrbl&quot;)" x-source-pkg="ts-camp-materials" x-part-tag="&quot;Katas&quot;">3.2.6<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Katas)"></a>Katas</h5><p><span class="Larger">AM &ndash; tue-fri 9:15am-10:00am</span></p><p><span class="Larger">PM &ndash; tue-fri 1:15pm-2:00pm</span></p><p>Breakout time where each camp is working independently with their Team Leader to
learn and earn katas in their curriculum. Here&rsquo;s how to optimize the LEARNING as
well as the FUN:</p><ul><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mix Up Tactics</span> &ndash; Be intentional in choosing tactics.
                Don&rsquo;t be afraid to try something new!</p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Quality over Quantity</span> &ndash; It is more important that the
                students actually earn the katas than get through any specific
                number of katas. To earn a kata, a student must be able to
                code the response to the given stimuli without hints. This does
                require repetition and practice to achieve a mix of memorization
                and comprehension. Just like learning a new language!</p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Don&rsquo;t Over Do It!</span> &ndash; Resist the temptation to &rsquo;just
                finish this one kata...&rsquo; and stretch over the 45 minute time
                block. In addition to students and TLs needing a break, getting
                off schedule adds extra stress of needing to catch up and cut
                time from other activities.</p></li></ul><p>Head Coach is working the whole classroom; checking in, offering advice and
encouragement, helping with any especially tricky bugs and assisting in behavior
management when needed.</p><h5 x-source-module="(lib &quot;ts-camp-materials/scribblings/manual.scrbl&quot;)" x-source-pkg="ts-camp-materials" x-part-tag="&quot;Snack_Break&quot;">3.2.7<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Snack_.Break)"></a>Snack Break</h5><p><span class="Larger">AM &ndash; mon 10:15am-10:30am &amp; tue-fri 10:00am-10:15am</span></p><p><span class="Larger">PM &ndash; mon 2:15pm-2:30pm &amp; tue-fri 2:00pm-2:15pm</span></p><p>This is <span style="font-weight: bold">Team Leader Break Time</span> as well. Head Coach should manage the
camp while TLs <span style="font-weight: bold">leave the camp room</span> and take a 15 minute break. If the HC
cannot fully focus on the entire camp for whatever reason (debugging the computers,
handling behavior issues), there is also the option to keep some or all TLs
during snack, and they can take their break during Game Time.</p><p>For the students, this is <span style="font-weight: bold">unstructured</span> break time. These are great times
for students to take a break from the computers, snack and relax! However,
<span style="font-weight: bold">even in unstructured time, staff should always be aware of, and in control of
the camp environment</span>. Remember:</p><ul><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">During breaks, all students are OFF computers.</span> This can be a hard rule to enforce all the time &ndash; what
                about the student who wants to keep coding, that&rsquo;s good
                right? Or the student who is a bit behind, and wants to spend
                break catching up? What if they are just playing their game?
                But really. <span class="Larger">Really.</span> Please make sure all students
                are completely off the computers during all breaks. Among
                other things, time away from the computer allows for students
                to get back in touch with those annoying physical bodies we
                have &ndash; and sometimes it&rsquo;s not until they step away
                from the screen that they realize &rsquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m hungry/thirsty/sore/need
                to go to the bathroom!&rsquo; <span style="font-weight: bold">This is a ThoughtSTEM Camp policy and needs to be followed!</span></p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Keep it sane and safe.</span> HC can (and should!) give the
                students some space during these breaks, but must stay attentive
                for student safety. There shouldn&rsquo;t be running or throwing things. 
                HC should also be mindful of conversations &ndash; keeping an ear
                out for topics that could upset or seem inappropriate to other
                students. <span style="font-weight: bold">Per ThoughtSTEM Policy, student phones and other
tech should remain off in student bags through all of camp,
breaks included.</span></p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Be mindful of ALL students.</span> Just like during the rest of
                camp, HC is working to make this as positive of an experience
                for each student as possible! To this end, <span style="font-weight: bold">watch for lonely kiddos</span>. Do your best to make every student feel welcomed, even it if means
                you just sit with that quiet student and chat about Spiderman for a

Sometimes this
will be one game for all ages, or a game for younger and a game for older students.
In either case, HC can divide the camp into two or more groups:</p><ul class="compact"><li><p>Whenever possible, mix up the camp groups.</p></li><li><p>HC can announce the games and let students choose which they want to play</p></li><li><p>Or HC can split by grade (this will still mix up camp groups, as long
as you do some crossing over; K-4 and 5-10 for example)</p></li></ul><p>HCs are welcome to pick thier own games to serve their specific group of students,
but keep in mind that while it can be tempting to stick with one game that
entertains, it can be worthwhile to try new things too!</p><p>Head Coaches run Game Time with all students from all camps; with support from Team
Leaders. By default, TLs are participating in games and helping create a
safe and fun environment. TLs also should step in to remind individual students to
listen or participate, as needed, so HC can focus on the larger group. Sometimes a HC
will ask TLs to lead a game, especially if the group is splitting up and playing two
different games.</p><p>Here are a whole bunch of <a href="Camp_Games.html" data-pltdoc="x">Camp Games</a>

Depending on student
progress and areas of challenge, the Team Leader may choose to do one or more of the
following, roughly ordered by priority:</p><ol><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Practice synthesizing different katas into one game &ndash; like they will
do in Game Jam!</span></p></li><li><p>Continue earning katas in the day&rsquo;s section, if TL feels like they
did not make enough progress earlier.</p></li><li><p>Go back and earn katas from a previous day&rsquo;s section, if TL feels that
the students will benefit from more skill in another area.</p></li></ol><p>On most days, the TLs should use this time to challenge students to
creatively use the knowledge they have gained through katas to build a more complex game.
The TL can combine two or more challenge cards (from sections that they have covered)
to create a custom challenge for their students. For example: It is day three and you
have learned Avatar, Enemies and Weapons. You pick an Avatar card that says "Make a game
with a pirateboy-sprite avatar." You pick a Weapons card that says "Make a game with a
sword that does 50 damage." You challenge your students to build a game with a pirateboy-sprite
avatar and a sword that does 50 damage.</p><h5 x-source-module="(lib &quot;ts-camp-materials/scribblings/manual.scrbl&quot;)" x-source-pkg="ts-camp-materials" x-part-tag="&quot;Game_Show&quot;">3.2.11<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Game_.Show)"></a>Game Show</h5><p><span class="Larger">AM &ndash; mon-thu 11:30am-11:45am</span></p><p><span class="Larger">PM &ndash; mon-thu 3:30pm-3:45pm</span></p><p>This activity starts as a whole camp activity lead by the Head Coach, before breaking out

before answering, playing for ThoughtSTEM Dollars or some other reward.</p><p>After asking the handful of all-access questions, HC passes off to TLs, who continue the
game show with questions specific to their camp and the katas learned that day. Rules and
rewards may change going from the big group to the smaller group, so be sure to review
before you start &ndash; "buzzers" or some other non-screaming answer strategy*, waiting to be
called on before answering, playing for ThoughtSTEM Dollars or some other reward.</p><p>* To make the Game Show more fun, HCs/TLs are encouraged to use a more active/fun way of
indicating that you know the answer than simply raising your hand. For example, when in
the whole camp group, high fiving the TL who then makes a buzzer noise. Then HC can call
on the TL who buzzes first, who can pick the student who high fived them first. Or, when
in camp teams, making your own answer buzzer sound!</p><h5 x-source-module="(lib &quot;ts-camp-materials/scribblings/manual.scrbl&quot;)" x-source-pkg="ts-camp-materials" x-part-tag="&quot;Market_Wrap_Up&quot;">3.2.12<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Market_.Wrap_.Up)"></a>Market/Wrap Up</h5><p><span class="Larger">AM &ndash; mon-thu 11:45am-12:00(ish)pm</span></p><p><span class="Larger">PM &ndash; mon-thu 3:45pm-4:00(ish)pm</span></p><p>At the end of every day there is an opportunity for Market.
