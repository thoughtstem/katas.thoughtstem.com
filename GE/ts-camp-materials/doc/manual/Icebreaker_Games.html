person, shake their hand and introduce themselves. HC then gives a conversation
prompt and 1 to 2 minutes for partners to learn about each other. This partner is
now their Handshake Partner. Students leave their Handshake Partner and walk around
the space once more. HC gives the instruction to high five the person nearest
them (someone different than before!) &ndash; this is their High Five Partner. They are
given another 1 to 2 minutes to answer a new conversation prompt, then move on.
HC prompts the students to find their Handshake Partner again (just to remind
them who they are!) before moving on to the next partner. Keep finding new partners

room. Each of these corners will be an answer to a question they will ask. HC
explains that they will say the question, assign an answer to each corner of the
room, THEN say "go." Once the HC has said go, THEN the students move to the
corner which most closely resembles their answer to the question. Once they gather
in their group, they briefly discuss a further question relevant to the first.

can work as well</p></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: bold">HOW TO PLAY:</span></p><p>Everyone except the Head Coach sits in a large circle. HC is in the middle of the
circle. HC explains that they will state a fact that is true about themselves
prefaced by "The Red Wind Blows for anyone who..." For example: &#8220;The red wind blows
for anyone who has been to Canada.&#8221; or &#8220;The red wind blows for anyone who has a
pet iguana&#8221;.
Then everyone for whom that fact also applies (anyone else who has a pet
iguana/has been to Canada) must get up from their seat and find a new one in the
circle. HC in the middle also is trying to find a seat. This will leave a new person
in the middle, who then shares.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">TIPS AND TRICKS:</span></p><ul class="compact"><li><p>I suggest making it "illegal" to move to the seat directly next
to you.</p></li><li><p>Remind students that this can be a quick game, but it is always a
SAFE game. No need to run.</p></li><li><p>Everyone should go at least once. If someone ends up in the
middle twice, have all students who haven&rsquo;t gone raise their hand,
and the middle student pick someone to swap with.</p></li><li><p>If someone gets stuck, prompt them with questions about
themselves (have you traveled somewhere interesting? Have you
ever been stung by a bee? Do you have any pets?)</p></li><li><p>Remind students that they can be their own judge in this game &ndash;
to limit follow up questions! If the fact feels true to them,
they should jump in. (Example: Middle says "The red wind blows for
anyone with a sister!" you have a step sister &ndash; does that count?!
Well do you think it counts? Go with your gut.)</p></li><li><p>Variation &ndash; include "levels." For level one, only
include physical attributes about yourself (hair color, what you
are wearing, if you have glasses etc). Level two is
likes/dislikes. Level three can be experiences.</p></li></ul><h4 x-source-module="(lib &quot;ts-camp-materials/scribblings/manual.scrbl&quot;)" x-source-pkg="ts-camp-materials" x-part-tag="&quot;String_Theory&quot;">8.5<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.String_.Theory)"></a>String Theory</h4><p><span style="font-weight: bold">NEED:</span></p><ul class="compact"><li><p>Ball of string or yarn</p></li><li><p>Scissors</p></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: bold">HOW TO PLAY:</span></p><p>Each team takes turns going up to the String Master (one of the teaching team
with the ball of string and scissors). One at a time, each student gets a length
of string from the String Master (leader rolls out the string and asks the
students to tell them when to cut it). Then <span style="font-weight: bold">after everyone has their string</span>
, Head Coach explains: each student must introduce and talk about themselves for
as long as it takes to wrap their length of string around their finger. They can
talk about likes/dislikes, dreams, skills, whatever. As long as they keep talking!</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">TIPS AND TRICKS:</span></p><ul class="compact"><li><p>This will likely be a game where students try to enforce the
rules on each other (&#8220;She&#8217;s going too slowly!&#8221; &#8220;He&#8217;s wrapping it
around all his fingers, not just one!&#8221; &#8220;They&#8217;re wrapping and not
talking!&#8221;). You will need to remind them that you are the teacher,
and as such, the ultimate decider and enforcer of rules. And they
will all just have to chill out.</p></li><li><p>If a student runs out of things to say, prompt them with questions.</p></li></ul><h4 x-source-module="(lib &quot;ts-camp-materials/scribblings/manual.scrbl&quot;)" x-source-pkg="ts-camp-materials" x-part-tag="&quot;Name_Alliteration&quot;">8.6<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Name_.Alliteration)"></a>Name Alliteration</h4><p><span style="font-weight: bold">NEED:</span></p><ul><li><p>Nothing!</p></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: bold">HOW TO PLAY:</span></p><p>Everyone circles up. Starting with the Head Coach, each person introduces
themselves with their name accompanied with an alliterative adjective. They should
also come up with a simple movement (loosely) to do with their alliterative name.
Everyone then repeats the name and the movement.</p><p>Examples: Jazzy Jason (snaps fingers), Super Sonny (super hero arm), Cool Carlos
(crosses arms), Dangerous David (spins in a circle), Genius Judith (taps forehead),
Stellar Stephen (mimes surfing), Genuine Jeron (thumbs up), Lovely Lindsey
(takes a bow).</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">TIPS AND TRICKS:</span></p><ul class="compact"><li><p>If a student cannot come up with an adjective, ask for three
suggestions from the rest of the class (maybe give one of your own
as well). Then the student must pick one of those (or come up with
their own).</p></li><li><p>If a student can&rsquo;t come up with a movement, you can suggest one or
two to them, or repeat the movement the student is doing
unconsciously (shrugging shoulders, fiddling with shirt hem, etc).</p></li><li><p>Remind students that we all are going to repeat their movement, so
pick something that we all can do safely (no splits or running into
the center of the circle, please!).</p></li><li><p>If you have a student who has done this name game before (earlier
in the day, a previous camp), challenge them to come up with a new
adjective and motion.</p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s fun to refer back to these alliterative names throughout the
camp!</p></li></ul><h4 x-source-module="(lib &quot;ts-camp-materials/scribblings/manual.scrbl&quot;)" x-source-pkg="ts-camp-materials" x-part-tag="&quot;The_Lying_Game&quot;">8.7<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.The_.Lying_.Game)"></a>The Lying Game</h4><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Recommended for older students, 6th grade +</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">NEED:</span></p><ul class="compact"><li><p>Pens/pencils</p></li><li><p>Enough slips of paper for everyone</p></li><li><p>2 bowls/hats/bags to put the papers in</p></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: bold">HOW TO PLAY:</span></p><p>Break the camp up into two teams. Game does NOT need to be played with
winning/losing teams, but can be played competitively in more mature groups. Each
team comes up with a <span style="font-weight: bold">true</span> fact about every player on their team that
believably could be about anyone on their team. For example "I lived in Hawaii for
6 years" is good! "I wear glasses" is not so good. "Sushi is my favorite food" is
good! "I speak 6 languages fluently" is not so good. Teams discuss and share the
facts amongst themselves so everyone know their team&rsquo;s facts &ndash; make sure to do it
quietly though so the other team does not overhear!</p><p>All of Team A&rsquo;s facts get put in one hat, all of Team B&rsquo;s facts are put in another
hat. Hats are then SWAPPED and Team A picks one fact each from B&rsquo;s pile, and 1 from
B&rsquo;s. Teams line up facing each other, paired randomly. Team A goes first &ndash; they
have 30 seconds to 1 minute to ask questions of their partner about the fact they
have in hand. Then, they swap roles. After both sides have gone, move down one and
repeat.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">THE GOAL OF THE GAME</span> is to figure out whose fact you have, while throwing
the other team off the scent on their hunt. Once everyone has interviewed the other
team&rsquo;s players they have a short time to confer amongst themselves on which fact be
longs to whom. Final guesses are shared, correct answers revealed, points tallied,
celebrations had.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara"><span style="font-weight: bold">INTERVIEW RULES</span>
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul class="compact"><li><p>Each round of questioning starts with interviewer stating the fact
they have in hand. This prevents the interviewer tricking the
interviewee into revealing the fact is not theirs.</p></li><li><p>You may NOT lie about your own fact. (example: your fact is "I have
been chased by a monkey." This happened in India. You cannot say
that it happened in Kansas.)</p></li><li><p>You SHOULD lie when it comes to other people&rsquo;s facts! (example: you
are being asked about the fact "I have never been out of the
country." You actually have been out of the country, but you SHOULD
say that you have not!)</p></li></ul></div></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">TIPS AND TRICKS:</span></p><ul class="compact"><li><p>Have at least one staff on each team to help guide towards good
facts etc.</p></li><li><p>Demo each step of the game, giving both good and bad examples of
facts to pick, how to interview, how to answer.</p></li><li><p>You could try adding a "script" to start each interview. For
example &ndash; Interviewer: "So you [want to live on the moon/only own
7 shirts/have 5 sisters]" Interviewee: "Yes, that&rsquo;s true!"
Interview: "Really!? (Asks follow up questions)"</p></li><li><p>A great way to find facts is to ask for a "story" from each player.
This will help prevent less interesting facts like "I like the
color green" and inspire funnier lies!</p></li></ul><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><form class="searchform"><input class="searchbox" style="color: #888;" type="text" value="...search manuals..." title="Enter a search string to search the manuals" onkeypress="return DoSearchKey(event, this, &quot;7.4&quot;, &quot;../&quot;);" onfocus="this.style.color=&quot;black&quot;; this.style.textAlign=&quot;left&quot;; if (this.value == &quot;...search manuals...&quot;) this.value=&quot;&quot;;" onblur="if (this.value.match(/^ *$/)) { this.style.color=&quot;#888&quot;; this.style.textAlign=&quot;center&quot;; this.value=&quot;...search manuals...&quot;; }"/></form>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../index.html" title="up to the documentation top" data-pltdoc="x" onclick="return GotoPLTRoot(&quot;7.4&quot;);">top</a></span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Game_Jam.html" title="backward to &quot;7 Game Jam&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">&larr; prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="up to &quot;Camp Resources&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Camp_Games.html" title="forward to &quot;9 Camp Games&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
